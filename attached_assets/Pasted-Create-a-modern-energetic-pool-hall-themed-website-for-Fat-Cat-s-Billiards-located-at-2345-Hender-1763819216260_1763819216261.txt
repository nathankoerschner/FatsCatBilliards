Create a modern, energetic, pool-hall themed website for Fat Cat’s Billiards, located at 2345 Hendersonville Rd, Arden, NC.
Use their official logo (attached image) and match the brand’s color palette:
electric pool-table blue (#21A8E0), deep navy/black, warm wood tones, and accent orange from the logo.

The design should feel like a clean, updated sports bar + billiards hall: bright blue felt, dark tables, neon-lit atmosphere, and tournament energy.

Include these sections:
